   <p> Although the earliest <b>machine learning</b> model was introduced 
    in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the
     winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning
      roots back to  </p> cades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes.
      [13] In <del> 1949 </del> 1948, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of 
      Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions 
      among nerve cells.[14] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for
       how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by 
       <u>computers to communicate data.[</u>>13] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems
        contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts 
        and<strong> Warren McCulloch</strong>, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up 
        with<mark> algorithms </mark>that mirror human thought processes
